# Ensam-interface - A Machine Learning GUI for Data Analysis

Webapp for auto machine learning tools used in ENSAM LCFC Lab

This project provides a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for applying machine learning algorithms to data analysis tasks. 

It caters to users with no prior programming experience, allowing them to leverage powerful machine learning tools for data exploration and insights. 
The GUI currently supports commonly used algorithms:
  - linear regression 📈,
  - decision trees 🌲,
  - support vector machines (SVM) ↪,
  - artificial neural networks 🧠,
  - K-means clustering 💦.
    
Users can upload datasets, select algorithms, and visualize results intuitively. Also, the project includes help guides for further studies in machine learning.
